# PyBank Instructions

In this Challenge, you are tasked with creating a Python script to analyze the financial records of your company. You will be given a financial dataset called budget_data.csv. The dataset is composed of two columns: "Date" and "Profit/Losses".

Your task is to create a Python script that analyzes the records to calculate each of the following values:

1. The total number of months included in the dataset

2. The net total amount of "Profit/Losses" over the entire period

3. The changes in "Profit/Losses" over the entire period, and then the average of those changes

4. The greatest increase in profits (date and amount) over the entire period

5. The greatest decrease in profits (date and amount) over the entire period

Your analysis should align with the following results:

# PyPoll Instructions
In this Challenge, you are tasked with helping a small, rural town modernize its vote-counting process.

You will be given a set of poll data called election_data.csv. The dataset is composed of three columns: "Voter ID", "County", and "Candidate". Your task is to create a Python script that analyzes the votes and calculates each of the following values:

1. The total number of votes cast

2. A complete list of candidates who received votes

3. The percentage of votes each candidate won

4. The total number of votes each candidate won

5. The winner of the election based on popular vote

6. Your analysis should align with the following results:

<!-- CONTRIBUTING -->

## Contributing

Contributions are what make the open source community such an amazing place to learn, inspire, and create. Any contributions you make are **greatly appreciated**.

  

If you have a suggestion that would make this better, please fork the repo and create a pull request. You can also simply open an issue with the tag "enhancement".

Don't forget to give the project a star! Thanks again!

  

1. Fork the Project

2. Create your Feature Branch (`git checkout -b new-branch-name`)

3. Commit your Changes (`git commit -m 'Add some message'`)

4. Push to the Branch (`git push origin new-branch-name`)

5. Create a pull request. 


Forking a repository and creating a pull request on GitHub is a great way to contribute to open-source projects. Here's a breakdown of the process:

1. Forking the Repository:

Find the repository you want to contribute to on GitHub.
Click on the "Fork" button in the top right corner. This creates a copy of the repository in your own account.

2. Clone the Forked Repository to Your Local Machine

You'll need Git installed on your system.
Use Git commands to clone your forked repository to your local machine. There will be instructions on the GitHub repository page for cloning.

3. Making Changes (Local Work):

Make your changes to the code in your local copy.
Use Git commands to track your changes (adding, committing).

4. Pushing Changes to Your Fork:

Once you're happy with your changes, use Git commands to push your local commits to your forked repository on GitHub.

5. Creating a Pull Request:

Go to your forked repository on GitHub.
Click the "Compare & pull request" button (might appear as a yellow banner).
Here, you'll see a comparison between your changes and the original repository.
Write a clear title and description for your pull request explaining the changes you made.
Click "Create Pull Request" to submit it for review.
